Because Nuvi is now your friend, you'll want to share things with her that no-one else knows. You can type things to Nuvi and she can repeat them or keep them secret. The better you get at coding, the more Nuvi can do - she can even help you do your work, if you teach her well!

## Using Repl.it

Today you will be using Repl.it to learn how to talk to Nuvi. Here is an example interactive window that you will use today:

<iframe height="600px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@msandfor/HelloNuvi#main.py?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

Before we start, let's first understand how the window works. The `main.py` file contains code, or the secret language you use to talk to Nuvi. By pressing the **run** button, you tell Nuvi to do what the code says. Any results from running the code will be displayed on the other screen, under the **result** tab. Today, our results will be a conversation you have with Nuvi.

Next, let's explain further some of the code that has been provided to you in the `main.py` file.

## print statements

Look at the top of the code. You will see the following line:

```
print("Hello Friend")
```

This statement allows us to print the words within quote marks to the other screen. It sounds simple, but we have to start small.

## Comments

The gray line that starts with `#` is called a **comment**. These are notes in the code that helps to explain what is happening in plain English to humans. As they are ignored by Nuvi, they are often used so that when other developers work on the same code, they will have an easier time reading and understanding what is going on.
